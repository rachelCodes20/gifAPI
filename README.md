# Giphy AP-HI! :wave: :wave:

## This project is a :tada: fun :tada: example of what you can produce with the GIPHY SDK. 

I built a gif that generates only a limited number of results, populating those in real time, as the user types into the input box. I accomplished this by editing the limit parameter in the endpoint.

## GIFs Galore!

GIPHY docs are phenomenal in their clear presentation of how to structure the endpoint necessary for a successful API call and render of GIF content.

## Carousel Time!

Next, I implemented a loop to iterate through some therapeutic (if I do say so myself) images courtesy of an onClick with the useState hook to capture the value of the current index, making a lovely carousel possible.
